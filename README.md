## 🔑 Environment Variables

| Variable              | Required | Description |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_API_URL`        | No       | Your backend API base URL. Leave empty to use the built-in localStorage mock. |
| `VITE_ANTHROPIC_KEY`  | Yes*     | Anthropic API key for Claude Vision. *Only required for direct browser calls (dev/demo). In production, proxy through your backend. |

---

## 🏗️ Connecting a Real Backend

All API calls are centralised in `src/services/`:

- **`authService.js`** — `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/logout`
- **`appointmentService.js`** — `/api/appointments` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE), `/api/appointments/slots`
- **`aiService.js`** — `/api/ai/analyse` (POST with `{ image: base64, mimeType }`)

When `VITE_API_URL` is set, every service file switches from the localStorage mock to real `fetch()` calls automatically. No other code changes needed.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)
```bash
npm run build
# Upload /dist to Vercel, or connect your GitHub repo.
# Set VITE_ANTHROPIC_KEY in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.
```

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Drag and drop /dist into Netlify, or connect GitHub.
```

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci && npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Never** expose `VITE_ANTHROPIC_KEY` in production builds. Proxy Claude API calls through your own backend.
- The localStorage mock is for development only — replace with a real auth backend before launch.
- All protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/check`, `/report`, `/appointment`) are wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>` which redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
